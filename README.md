# Kaggle_dataset

This project is built using data sourced from Kaggle, connected through a kaggle.json API key for seamless integration with Google Colab. The objective of the project is to analyze the dataset efficiently using Python-based data science tools like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. By hosting and running this project in Google Colab, anyone can easily access, run, and modify the code without local setup. Make sure to upload your kaggle.json file before accessing the dataset.

Dataset Access using Kaggle API:

We authenticate with the Kaggle API using the kaggle.json file and download the dataset directly into the Google Colab environment.

Data Loading & Initial Inspection:

Using pandas to read the data into a DataFrame and perform basic exploration with .head(), .info(), and .describe().

Data Cleaning:

Handling missing values, renaming columns, and formatting date/time fields.

Removing duplicates and converting data types for consistency.

Data Analysis:

Using filtering, grouping (groupby), and aggregation techniques to draw insights.

Applying logic conditions to derive new columns.

Data Visualization:

Creating graphs using matplotlib and seaborn to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies.

Visuals Countplot.
