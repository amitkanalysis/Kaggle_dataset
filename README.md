# Kaggle_dataset

This project is built using data sourced from Kaggle, connected through a kaggle.json API key for seamless integration with Google Colab. The objective of the project is to analyze the dataset efficiently using Python-based data science tools like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. By hosting and running this project in Google Colab, anyone can easily access, run, and modify the code without local setup. Make sure to upload your kaggle.json file before accessing the dataset.
